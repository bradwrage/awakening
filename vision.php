		<h4>Our Vision</h4>
		<p>Sometimes it feels like weâ€™re just sleepwalking through life, breathing but not really alive. At Awakening, we believe that something more is available to all of us. We long to be a community of faith, hope, and love in the Silicon Valley, centered on Christ and intent on making a difference here and now. </p>
		<p>We are students and professionals, singles and families, artists and entrepreneurs, creatives and intellectuals, and everything in between. All are welcome, without condition. Come as you are. </p>

		<p>We gather on Sundays at 10:30am + 7pm at <a href="">Del Mar High School</a> to learn, sing and be together. We consider this our inhale, a chance to be inspired and equipped as we start our week. We also gather midweek in homes to experience family, learn the ways of Jesus, and serve our city together. We consider this our exhale, a living out of the call to unite ourselves with Christ and others. </p>
		<h4 class="runner">We exist to awaken this generation to new life in Jesus Christ.</h4>
