		<h4>Missional Communities</h4>
		<p>Missional Communities are midweek gatherings of anywhere between 6-20 people who gather in homes throughout the city. We’ve found that the stage of life you’re in greatly influences the size and style of group you’re drawn to. Whether you’re a college student, young professional, newlyweds, a single parent, a young family with little kids, or all grown up with grown up kids, we’ll be able to plug you into a Missional Community that works for you and allows you to thrive!</p>

	<p><span class="title-span">Family: </span>At the heart of a Missional Community is the relational harbor of a ‘gospel’ family. Jesus himself said, “…whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” [Matthew 12:50] We have been adopted into Jesus’ family. As such we can and should experience the protection, care and nurture of a family that lives according to its Father’s will and intentions. It is here that we give and receive the fullness of God’s love and daily display the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.</p>

	<p><span class="title-span">Discipleship: </span>Jesus came to restore the potential of human life as his Father had intended it to be; full and free. The more fully we realize this potential, the more completely we express the image of our God to each other. The Holy Spirit and the scriptures have been given to us to lead us in an ever-transforming life as disciples of Jesus. But we must be diligent and disciplined to follow after Jesus who said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.” [John 8:31-32]</p>

	<p><span class="title-span">Growth: </span>All of human history is the unfolding story of God the Creator working for the restoration of all that he has created. We call this work of restoration ‘the mission of God.’ God is always seeking the partnership of communities of people. He chooses one people, restores them and then sends them out to restore another people. As Missional Communities we are sent out together to seek the restoration of all who do not know Jesus; family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and classmates.
